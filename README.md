# CMSC434-mobileapp
<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>Upon downloading and opening the app, you will land on the WHO fragment, which is one of the five fragments (WHO, WHAT, WHERE, WHEN, HOW). You can either click the tab bar on the bottom to navigate around the app, or simply swipe each fragment. The app will have the full functionality ONLY IF you have Maps App installed on your phone.</p>

## Running the code
Download the code as a zip file. <br />
In the folder it was saved, extract-all (I used 7zip) <br />
Open Android Studio <br />
On the quick start menu click Import project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc.) <br />
Navigate to where you extracted the files, you should see cmsc434-mobileapp (with the android studio symbol) in that location<br />
Click on cmsc434-mobileapp and click ok <br />
The project should be loaded in. <br />

<li>The swipe/tab functionality came from code provided to Jay from his CMSC436 class. It served as a template for the majority of the files in this project.</li>
