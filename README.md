# CMSC434-mobileapp
<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>Upon downloading and opening the app, you will land on the WHO fragment, which is one of the five fragments (WHO, WHAT, WHERE, WHEN, HOW). You can either click the tab bar on the bottom to navigate around the app, or simply swipe each fragment. The app will have the full functionality ONLY IF you have Maps App installed on your phone.</p>

<h4>Reference:</h4> 
<ul>
<li>The swipe/tab functionality came from code provided to Jay from his CMSC436 class. It served as a template for the majority of the files in this project.</li>
