# Empowering The Voter: CMSC434-mobileapp
<p>This github repo implements the mobile app for Team 2's Empowering the Voter project for CSMC434. The mobile app was implemented in Android and the goal of this mobile app is to help voters manage the election process by providing them key election info and allowing them to modify notifications and check notification history. </p>

<p>Team 2 is composed of four seniors: Jay Zhang, Justin Miller, Cindy Ren, and Mihai Sirbu. Jay and Justin were in charge of this mobile app and worked on its implementation throughout all three versions.  </p>

<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>Upon downloading and opening the app, you will land on the WHO fragment, which is one of the five fragments (WHO, WHAT, WHERE, WHEN, HOW). You can either click the tab bar on the bottom to navigate around the app, or simply swipe each fragment. The app will have the full functionality ONLY IF you have Maps App installed on your phone.</p>

<h2>Running the code:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Download the code as a zip file</li>
<li>In the folder it was saved, extract-all (I used 7zip)</li>
<li>Open Android Studio</li>
<li>On the quick start menu click Import project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc.)</li>
<li>Navigate to where you extracted the files, you should see cmsc434-mobileapp (with the android studio symbol) in that location</li>
<li>Click on cmsc434-mobileapp and click ok</li>
<li>The project should be loaded in</li>
</ul>

<h4>Reference:</h4> 
<ul>
<li>The swipe/tab functionality came from code provided to Jay from his CMSC436 class. It served as a template for the majority of the files in this project.</li>
