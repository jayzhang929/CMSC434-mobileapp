    <string name="what_definition">A general election is an election in which all or most members of a given political body are chosen. The term is usually used to refer to elections held for a nation\'s primary legislative body, as distinguished from by-elections and local elections.</string>
    <string name="what_presidential_system">In presidential systems, the term refers to a regularly scheduled election where both the president, and either "a class" of or all members of the national legislature are elected at the same time but sometimes refers to special elections held to fill prematurely vacated positions. A general election day may also include elections for local officials.</string>

    <string name="how_definition">An election for President of the United States occurs every four years on Election Day, held the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November.</string>
    <string name="how_candidate_process">The 2016 Presidential election will be held on November 8, 2016.The election process begins with the primary elections and caucuses and moves to nominating conventions, during which political parties each select a nominee to unite behind. The nominee also announces a Vice Presidential running mate at this time. The candidates then campaign across the country to explain their views and plans to voters and participate in debates with candidates from other parties.</string>
    <string name="how_information">During the general election, Americans head to the polls to cast their vote for President. But the tally of those votes—the popular vote—does not determine the winner. Instead, Presidential elections use the Electoral College. To win the election, a candidate must receive a majority of electoral votes. In the event no candidate receives the majority, the House of Representatives chooses the President and the Senate chooses the Vice President.</string>
